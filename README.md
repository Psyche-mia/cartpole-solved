Python 3.6 + PyTorch

This implementation is **not** designed for high performance and flexibility.
The idea is to have most important DQN extensions in a simple and clean code in one file, solving classic `CartPole` problem. It's basic playground for understanding these algorithms.

Notebooks work on Colaboratory, no setup required.
Open and train from scratch, it takes one minute.
